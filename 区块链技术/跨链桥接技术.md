1. 对于不同的异构链，会有不同的共识算法，接入中继链的话，需要一个特殊的桥接器来

   在polkadot中，这个桥接器是Parachain。

2. cosmos 连接ether的难点

   需要一个转换的装置，如果把这个转化过程放在以太坊的合约内部的话，gas的消耗太大，所以把这部分的功能放到以太坊外面来做。

3. Polkadot 设计哲学

   分离区块链的两种东西：liveness和finality

   > Ethereum is the most widely used smart contract platform. Most of the private enterprise chains have also selected Ethereum as their platform of choice. Therefore, interconnectivity with Ethereum becomes very important for Polkadot.
   >
   > To send a transaction from Polkadot to Ethereum, a solidity smart contract called “break-in contract” supported by Ethereum can be used. This contract can maintain up to 144 signatories and the contract is maintained by these signatories. Anyone interested in moving relay-chain data into Ethereum is incentivized for forwarding valid block data. With 144 validators, the validity of the block can be finalized with as little as 97 validators (144*⅔ + 1). Assuming a conservative estimate of the daily rotation of validators, the team estimates the cost of maintaining the network to be around 540,000 gas every day. A basic transaction forwarded over the bridge would cost $0.11 with additional contract computation costing more. This works out to be about $45 per year *(gas is priced in gwei. Thus, the cost is computed as the following. 540,000\*ETH_price\*10^(-9)\*gas_price)*. With further developments in Ethereum, this cost and efficiency are expected to improve.

   > When a transaction is to be sent from Ethereum to a particular parachain on Polkadot, “break-out contract” is used. The contract charges a necessary payment and issues a logging instruction to prove its existence, through a Merkle proof, and validity of the block header. Though it is straightforward to prove the validity, validators need to run a full node of Ethereum, which is a rather heavy dependency. Lightweight methods are conceivable which involve third parties that submit ‘SPV’ (Special Payment Verification) like proofs of invalid headers to punish malicious actors.
